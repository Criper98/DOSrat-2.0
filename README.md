The purpose of this project is to test my knowledge, and share it with you, it won't be much but it's my milestone, i hope to improve myself and maybe provide an alternative to remote control software.

In practice DOSrat 2.0 is a remote administration tool (RAT), successor of the first [DOSrat](https://github.com/Criper98/DOSrat) project, it has several improvements in TCP/IP communication, a better command line interface, a totally different client build system which makes it more light and fast, and many more features beyond those already existing in its predecessor.

## BETA

Currently the software is in BETA, the versions will still be published in the Release section but will have the wording "-b.X".<br/>
Updates will be downloaded and installed automatically if you keep the option active.<br/>

Among the priorities of the project is backwards compatibility, the goal is to maintain the possibility of running new functions on old Clients without breaking them, and the functionality of remotely updating a Client is already available.

## Release 2.0.0 Goals

The priorities to get to the first 2.0.0 Release are:
* Provide the ability to choose between English and Italian, and create a system to allow anyone to add a translation.
* Implement key features like ability to see remote desktop, remote file explorer, remote control from Telegram bot, and much moreâ€¦
* Provide a backward compatibility basis for future updates.
* Implement a stable TCP/IP connection system.
